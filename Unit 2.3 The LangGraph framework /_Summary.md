# ðŸ§  Unit 2.3: The LangGraph Framework â€” Summary

## ðŸš€ Module Goals
- Introduce **LangGraph**, a framework for building **production-ready**, graph-based LLM workflows with explicit control over logic and state.
- Learn how to orchestrate **nodes** and **edges** to define multi-step, conditional, and stateful LLM-driven processes.

---

## 1. What Is LangGraph?
LangGraph is based on a **directed graph** structure where each node is a Python function (e.g., an LLM call or tool action), and edges define the execution flow.  
It provides better control and structure than free-form agent code, especially for production environments.

---

## 2. Building Blocks of LangGraph
Key components include:
- **State**: A persistent dictionary-like object that stores the evolving context.
- **Nodes**: Functions that operate on the state (e.g., calling an LLM, performing classification).
- **Edges**: Define transitions between nodes, either static or based on conditions.
- **StateGraph**: The main object that defines and executes the graph.

---

## 3. Building Your First LangGraph
The course walks through a complete example with Alfred:
- Define a `TypedDict` for state
- Create logic nodes (e.g., classify email, generate response)
- Use conditions to branch based on classification
- Chain nodes with `START` and `END` to complete the flow

---

## 4. Document Analysis Graph
This more advanced example uses:
- A **Vision model** to read documents
- A **calculator tool** to compute values
- A **reasoning loop** to refine answers
LangGraph enables looping logic and branching paths based on dynamic decisions until a task is completed.

---

## âœ… Why LangGraph Stands Out
- Offers **explicit control** over flow, unlike more implicit frameworks
- Supports **looping, branching, retries, and async** execution
- Comes with built-in **visualization**, **state tracking**, and is well-suited for production deployment
