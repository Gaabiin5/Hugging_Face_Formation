## üí¨ Feedback on Unit 2.1 ‚Äî SmolAgents

### üîÑ Systematic Use of Inference Models
- The course heavily relies on **inference models** (e.g., from Hugging Face, OpenAI, etc.).
- This presents some issues:
  - These models often come with **limited free usage quotas**.
  - There is **no clear guidance** on how to switch to **local models** as a drop-in replacement.

### üñ•Ô∏è Local Alternative with Ollama
- I explored using **Ollama** to run models locally and avoid quota limits.
- While this is a great alternative in principle, I encountered several limitations:
  - The course provides **no instructions** or examples for configuring agents to use local models via Ollama.
  - It would be helpful to see how to modify the `llm` parameter or setup to integrate local LLMs seamlessly.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Installation Issues with Ollama
- Initially, Ollama only worked in **CPU mode**, which significantly slowed down performance.
- I resolved this by **updating GPU drivers**, but this step could be a blocker for users less familiar with hardware setup.

### ‚ùå Frequent Execution Errors
- I experienced **frequent runtime errors** when running agents, likely caused by:
  - Switching between **remote inference models** and **local models**.
  - Some tools or generated code seemed incompatible with the model being used.
- These issues highlight the fragility of agent behavior when **changing LLM backends** without code-level adaptation.

---

## ‚úÖ Suggestions
- Provide a **clear configuration pattern** to toggle between remote and local models.
- Add a **dedicated section or guide** explaining how to:
  - Integrate Ollama or other local model providers.
  - Adjust prompts, tool formats, or execution modes depending on the model type.
- Improve **error handling and debugging support** in smolagents (e.g., fallback behavior, clearer logs).

---

## üîö Conclusion
- SmolAgents is a powerful and lightweight framework with great learning value.
- However, improving support for **local LLM integration** and **hybrid configurations** would make it more robust and accessible for developers working without constant access to remote APIs.
