3. (Optional) Look up any unrecognizable food names.
4. Note the remaining unique food (turtle soup).
5. Open the XML.
6. Find the CATEGORIES label.
7. Note the matching text element for the food (Soups and Stews).
Tools:
1. Excel file access
2. XML file access
3. (Optional) Web browser
4. (Optional) Search engine
Final Answer: Soups and Stews

Question 3: In NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day on 2006 January 21, two astronauts are visible, with one appearing much smaller than the other. As of August 2023, out of the astronauts in the NASA Astronaut Group that the smaller astronaut was a member of, which one spent the least time in space, and how many minutes did he spend in space, rounded to the nearest minute? Exclude any astronauts who did not spend any time in space. Give the last name of the astronaut, separated from the number of minutes by a semicolon.
Steps:
1. Use search engine to search for "NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day 2006 January 21".
2. Open the link to the image.
3. Read the explanation to find that the image is of astronaut Charles "Pete" Conrad reflected in the helmet of astronaut Alan Bean.
4. Observe that the smaller astronaut in the image is the one reflected in the other's helmet, so the smaller astronaut must be Charles "Pete" Conrad.
5. Go to the Wikipedia page for Charles "Pete" Conrad.
6. Search for "Astronaut Group" to find that Conrad was a member of NASA Astronaut Group 2.
7. Open the Wikipedia pages for each member of NASA Astronaut Group 2.
8. For those who are not deceased, go to View history and select the latest version of their Wikipedia page as of August 2023.
9. Compare the times listed in the infobox of each astronaut's Wikipedia page under "Time in space", observing that Ed White has the least time in space with 4d 01h 56m, but also that Elliott See does not have a listed "Time in space".
10. Read through Elliot See's Wikipedia article to find that he died in an accident before his first space flight, so he should be excluded, making Ed White's 4d 01h 56m the least amount of time in space.
11. Convert 4d 01h 56m to minutes: 4d * 24h/d * 60m/h + 1h * 60m/h + 56m = 5,876m
12. Format the final answer as specified: White; 5,876
