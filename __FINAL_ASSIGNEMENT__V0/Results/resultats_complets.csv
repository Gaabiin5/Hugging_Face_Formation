Question 5: The following numbers function similarly to ISBN 13 numbers, however, their validation methods are slightly different. Rather than using alternate weights of 1 and 3, the checksum digit is calculated with an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. Otherwise, the checksum digit is calculated as expected. Unfortunately, there is an error in the data. Two adjacent columns have been transposed. These errored columns do not involve the final column or one of the first three columns. Using this information, please provide all potential solutions with the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two errored columns (assume we start our indexing at 0 and ignore hyphens). Give your answer in the form x, y where x is the weight and y is the smaller index of the two transposed columns.

Steps:
1. Consider the numbers as if the first potential columns were the ones transposed, which would be smallest index 3 giving solution (n, 3).
2. ""Fix"" the columns in the first number and see if any n from 1-9 can generate the proper check digit. Calculations:
978-354181391-9
978-534181391-9
(9+7n+8+5n+3+4n+1+8n+1+3n+9+1n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 9)
n = 5 is our only possible solution if these are the transposed columns.
3. ""Fix"" the columns in the second number and see if n = 5 is still a solution:
978-946669746-1
978-496669746-1
(9+7n+8+4n+9+6n+6+6n+9+7n+4+6n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 1)
When n = 5, (9+7n+8+4n+9+6n+6+6n+9+7n+4+6n) mod 10 ≡ 5, so this fails. There is no consistent solution if columns 3 and 4 are transposed.
4. See if there is a valid solution for (n, 4) or columns 4 and 5 transposed under some weight n.
5. ""Fix"" the columns in the first number and see if any n from 1-9 can generate the proper check digit. Calculations:
978-354181391-9
978-345181391-9
(9+7n+8+3n+4+5n+1+8n+1+3n+9+1n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 9)
n = 7 is our only possible solution if these are the transposed columns.
6. ""Fix"" the columns in the second number and see if n = 7 is still a solution:
978-946669746-1
978-964669746-1
(9+7n+8+9n+6+4n+6+6n+9+7n+4+6n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 1)
When n = 7, (9+7n+8+9n+6+4n+6+6n+9+7n+4+6n) mod 10 ≡ 5, so this fails. There is no consistent solution if columns 4 and 5 are transposed.
7. See if there is a valid solution for (n, 5) or columns 5 and 6 transposed under some weight n.
8. ""Fix"" the columns in the first number and see if any n from 1-9 can generate the proper check digit. Calculations:
978-354181391-9
978-351481391-9
(9+7n+8+3n+5+1n+4+8n+1+3n+9+1n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 9)
n = 5 is our only possible solution if these are the transposed columns.
9. ""Fix"" the columns in the second number and see if n = 5 is still a solution:
978-946669746-1
978-946669746-1
(9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+6n+9+7n+4+6n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 1)
When n = 5, (9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+6n+9+7n+4+6n) mod 10 ≡ 5, so this fails. There is no consistent solution if columns 5 and 6 are transposed.
10. See if there is a valid solution for (n, 6) or columns 6 and 7 transposed under some weight n.
11. ""Fix"" the columns in the first number and see if any n from 1-9 can generate the proper check digit. Calculations:
978-354181391-9
978-354811391-9
(9+7n+8+3n+5+4n+8+1n+1+3n+9+1n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 9)
n = 9 is our only possible solution if these are the transposed columns.
12. ""Fix"" the columns in the second number and see if n = 9 is still a solution:
978-946669746-1
978-946669746-1
(9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+6n+9+7n+4+6n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 1)
When n = 9, (9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+6n+9+7n+4+6n) mod 10 ≡ 9, so this solution holds for the second number.
13. ""Fix"" the columns in the third number and see if n = 9 is still a solution:
978-398036139-6
978-398306139-6
(9+7n+8+3n+9+8n+3+0n+6+1n+3+9n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 6)
When n = 9, (9+7n+8+3n+9+8n+3+0n+6+1n+3+9n) mod 10 ≡ 0, so this fails. There is no consistent solution if columns 6 and 7 are transposed.
14. See if there is a valid solution for (n, 7) or columns 7 and 8 transposed under some weight n.
15. ""Fix"" the columns in the first number and see if any n from 1-9 can generate the proper check digit. Calculations:
978-354181391-9
978-354118391-9
(9+7n+8+3n+5+4n+1+1n+8+3n+9+1n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 9)
n = 9 is our only possible solution if these are the transposed columns.
16. ""Fix"" the columns in the second number and see if n = 9 is still a solution:
978-946669746-1
978-946696746-1
(9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+9n+6+7n+4+6n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 1)
When n = 9, (9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+9n+6+7n+4+6n) mod 10 ≡ 3, so this fails. There is no consistent solution if columns 7 and 8 are transposed.
17. See if there is a valid solution for (n, 8) or columns 8 and 9 transposed under some weight n.
18. ""Fix"" the columns in the first number and see if any n from 1-9 can generate the proper check digit. Calculations:
978-354181391-9
978-354183191-9
(9+7n+8+3n+5+4n+1+8n+3+1n+9+1n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 9)
n = 4 and n = 9 are both possible solutions to this modular equation.
19. ""Fix"" the columns in the second number and see if n = 4 and n = 9 are still solutions:
978-946669746-1
978-946667946-1
(9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+6n+7+9n+4+6n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 1)
When n = 4, (9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+6n+7+9n+4+6n) mod 10 ≡ 0. When n = 9, (9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+6n+7+9n+4+6n) mod 10 ≡ 5. As neither solution found works for the second number, this fails. There is no consistent solution if columns 8 and 9 are transposed.
20. See if there is a valid solution for (n, 9) or columns 9 and 10 transposed under some weight n.
21. ""Fix"" the columns in the first number and see if any n from 1-9 can generate the proper check digit. Calculations:
978-354181391-9

978-946667496-1
(9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+6n+7+4n+9+6n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 1)
When n = 2, (9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+6n+7+4n+9+6n) mod 10 ≡ 9 and when n = 7 (9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+6n+7+4n+9+6n) mod 10 ≡ 9, so both n = 2 and n = 7 remain consistent.
23. ""Fix"" the columns in the third number and see if n = 2 and n = 7 are still solutions:
978-398036139-6
978-398036319-6
(9+7n+8+3n+9+8n+0+3n+6+3n+1+9n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 6)
When n = 2, (9+7n+8+3n+9+8n+0+3n+6+3n+1+9n) mod 10 ≡ 9, so n cannot be 2. When n = 7, (9+7n+8+3n+9+8n+0+3n+6+3n+1+9n) mod 10 ≡ 4, so this solution is still consistent.
24. ""Fix"" the columns in the fourth number and see if n = 7 is still a solution:
978-447656680-4
978-447656860-4
When n = 7, (9+7n+8+4n+4+7n+6+5n+6+8n+6+0n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 4)
(9+7n+8+4n+4+7n+6+5n+6+8n+6+0n) mod 10 ≡ 6, so n = 7 is still a potential solution.
24. ""Fix"" the columns in the fifth number and see if n = 7 is still a solution:

978-279586664-7
(9+7n+8+2n+7+9n+5+8n+6+6n+6+4n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 7)
When n = 7, (9+7n+8+2n+7+9n+5+8n+6+6n+6+4n) mod 10 ≡ 3, so n = 7 is still a potential solution.

When n = 7, (9+7n+8+5n+9+1n+1+7n+8+2n+1+5n) mod 10 ≡ 5, so n = 7 is still a potential solution.
27. ""Fix"" the columns in the ninth number and see if n = 7 is still a solution:

When n = 7, (9+7n+8+4n+1+4n+8+2n+5+5n+1+5n) mod 10 ≡ 1, so n = 7 is a consistent solution for all the numbers given. This means that (7, 9) is a solution to the problem.
29. As the problem asks for all possible solutions, we need to check to see if there is a valid solution for (n, 10) or columns 10 and 11 transposed under some weight n even though we found a solution already. It is possible the solution we found is not unique.
30. ""Fix"" the columns in the first number and see if any n from 1-9 can generate the proper check digit. Calculations:
978-354181391-9
978-354181319-9
(9+7n+8+3n+5+4n+1+8n+1+3n+1+9n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 9)
n = 4 and n = 9 are both possible solutions to this modular equation.

Otherwise, the checksum digit is calculated as expected. Unfortunately, there is an error in the data. Two adjacent columns have been transposed. These errored columns do not involve the final column or one of the first three columns. Using this information, please provide all potential solutions with the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two errored columns (assume we start our indexing at 0 and ignore hyphens). Give your answer in the form x, y where x is the weight and y is the smaller index of the two transposed columns.

Steps:
1. Consider the numbers as if the first potential columns were the ones transposed, which would be smallest index 3 giving solution (n, 3).
2. ""Fix"" the columns in the first number and see if any n from 1-9 can generate the proper check digit. Calculations:
978-354181391-9
978-534181391-9
(9+7n+8+5n+3+4n+1+8n+1+3n+9+1n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 9)
n = 5 is our only possible solution if these are the transposed columns.

978-496669746-1
(9+7n+8+4n+9+6n+6+6n+9+7n+4+6n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 1)
When n = 5, (9+7n+8+4n+9+6n+6+6n+9+7n+4+6n) mod 10 ≡ 5, so this fails. There is no consistent solution if columns 3 and 4 are transposed.

n = 9 is our only possible solution if these are the transposed columns.
12. ""Fix"" the columns in the second number and see if n = 9 is still a solution:
978-946669746-1
978-946669746-1
(9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+6n+9+7n+4+6n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 1)
When n = 9, (9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+6n+9+7n+4+6n) mod 10 ≡ 9, so this solution holds for the second number.
13. ""Fix"" the columns in the third number and see if n = 9 is still a solution:

Question 5: The following numbers function similarly to ISBN 13 numbers, however, their validation methods are slightly different. Rather than using alternate weights of 1 and 3, the checksum digit is calculated with an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. Otherwise, the checksum digit is calculated as expected. Unfortunately, there is an error in the data. Two adjacent columns have been transposed. These errored columns do not involve the final column or one of the first three columns. Using this information, please provide all potential solutions with the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two errored columns (assume we start our indexing at 0 and ignore hyphens). Give your answer in the form x, y where x is the weight and y is the smaller index of the two transposed columns.

Question 5: The following numbers function similarly to ISBN 13 numbers, however, their validation methods are slightly different. Rather than using alternate weights of 1 and 3, the checksum digit is calculated with an alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10. Otherwise, the checksum digit is calculated as expected. Unfortunately, there is an error in the data. Two adjacent columns have been transposed. These errored columns do not involve the final column or one of the first three columns. Using this information, please provide all potential solutions with the unknown weight and the smaller index of the two errored columns (assume we start our indexing at 0 and ignore hyphens). Give your answer in the form x, y where x is the weight and y is the smaller index of the two transposed columns.

n = 4 and n = 9 are both possible solutions to this modular equation.
31. ""Fix"" the columns in the second number and see if n = 4 and n = 9 are still solutions:
978-946669746-1
978-946669764-1
(9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+6n+9+7n+6+4n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 1)
When n = 4, (9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+6n+9+7n+6+4n) mod 10 ≡ 8, so n cannot be 4. When n = 9, (9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+6n+9+7n+6+4n) mod 10 ≡ 3, so n cannot be 9. As neither solution found works for the second number, this fails. There is no consistent solution if columns 10 and 11 are transposed.
32. We checked all possible forms of the error and found only one potential solution, (7, 9) so this is our only answer.
